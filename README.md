# PyBer_Analysis
## Overveiw of Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis was to compile data on rides and fares between different cities and present the data in a visual. To accomplish this we coded in Pandas to compile the CSV and present the data using the tools avalible with Matplotlib.
## Results

In looking at the the above chart, it illustrates the profit made from the service in each area, `rural`, `suburban`, `Urban`. it shows that the overall profits are stable across all three areas though there difference in overall profit shows a trend of increase depending on how Urban the area of operation is, this suggest that the operations that are most succesful and should be focused on are urban operation since they bring in a multiple times greater profit that suburban or rural.

In looking at the data presented above in how it shows profits, it shows that the cost of individual rides increases the more rural the area gets, however in matching the trends and data showcased in the chart the profits are still higher the more urban the area of is, and this data presented gives increased detail in why the profits trend in the way they do. As the number of rides allows for much lower average fares per ride in order to make signifigantly more profit than in areas where it is lower amounts of rides but higher average fares.
## Summary of Proposal
In accordance with the results of this analysis what we would recomend is
- Is first a change in future analysis of data to considered the full year and as well multiple different years to account for different factors that could affect fares. 
- Attempting to increase drivier numbers in less urban areas may allow for increased number of rides in those lees urban areas and bridge profits, as not as many rides need to be comleted in order to reach the same profits due to the increased average fare per ride.
- Finally in looking at average fare per driver, collecting data about rides that shows what creates the disparity between these fares could give good insight into what could be changed in order to lessen disparties between the different areas of operaration.
